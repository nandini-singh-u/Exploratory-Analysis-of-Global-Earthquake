Exploratory Analysis of Global Earthquake-Tsunami Events (2001–2022)
Objective:
To conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python on the Global Earthquake-Tsunami
Risk Assessment Dataset. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and differences between tsunamigenerating and non-tsunami earthquakes based on seismic features, using statistical summaries and
visualizations — all implemented using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Key Objectives:
1. Time-Based Analysis:
o Explore how earthquake occurrences and tsunami events have changed over the 22-year
period (2001–2022).
o Identify any trends in the frequency or magnitude of earthquakes over time.
2. Magnitude and Depth Analysis:
o Analyze the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and depths.
o Compare the average magnitude and depth of tsunami vs. non-tsunami events.
o Highlight major earthquakes (≥8.0) and their characteristics.
3. Geographic Distribution Using 2D Plotting:
o Plot earthquake locations using latitude and longitude on a 2D scatter plot.
o Visually distinguish between tsunami and non-tsunami events.
o Identify clusters or regions with higher concentration of tsunami events (without using map
tiles or interactive maps).
4. Statistical and Comparative Analysis:
o Use box plots, histograms, and bar charts to compare seismic features between tsunami
and non-tsunami events.
o Analyze correlations between variables using heatmaps.
5. Insights and Observations:
o Summarize key differences in seismic behavior between tsunami and non-tsunami
earthquakes.
o Identify seismic thresholds or indicators associated with increased tsunami potential.
Python Libraries to Use:
• Pandas – for data loading and manipulation
• NumPy – for numerical operations
• Matplotlib & Seaborn – for creating all visualizations including:
o Time-series plots
o Histograms and box plots
o 2D scatter plots of latitude vs. longitude (static mapping)
o Heatmaps for correlation analysis
Expected Deliverables:
1. Jupyter Notebook or Python script with:
o Clean and well-structured code
o Visualizations for each analysis step
o Clear observations and comments
2. Summary Report (optional):
o Key findings from the analysis
o Visual summaries of tsunami risk factors
o Interpretation of patterns in earthquake characteristics
